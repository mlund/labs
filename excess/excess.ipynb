    "_Litterature: Frenkel and Smith, Understanding Molecular Simulation_, Chapters 3 and 5.\n",
    "[[Open Access within LU]](http://ludwig.lub.lu.se/login?url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780122673511)\n",
    "\n",
    "Metropolis Monte Carlo is an importance sampling technique where we bias the otherwise random MC method to sample points in coordinate space that _contribute_ to properties of interest. In molecular systems, configurations (microstates) with energies much higher than the thermal energy, $k_BT$, have a very low probability due to the Boltzmann factor, $P(U) = \\exp(-U/k_BT)$, and therefore do not need to be frequently explored.\n",
    "In MC, we perform a finite number of _trial moves_ where the system is taken from on old state ($o$) to a new state ($n$) giving rise to an energy change $\\Delta U$.\n",
    "The move is accepted or rejected based in the following _acceptance criterion_,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "acc(o\\rightarrow n) = \\min(1, e^{-\\Delta U/k_BT})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which will ensure that low energy states are more likely to occur than high energy states. Thus, if the energy decreases ($e^{-\\Delta U/k_BT}>1$) the move is always accepted.\n",
    "Temperature and entropy enters the algorithm by allowing acceptance also for moves that leads to an energy _increase_.\n",
    "As $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, all configurations are accepted leading to equal population of all states.\n",
    "When $T\\rightarrow 0$ the system propagates towards a (local) minimum or ground state as expected from statistical thermodynamics.\n",
    "It is important to realize that the Metropolis MC algorithm only provide information on _equilibrium properties_.\n",
    "Thus from a MC simulation we cannot say anything about time-dependent or dynamic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MC program we will use in this lab, two moves are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Translational particle moves\n",
    "2. Particle insertion and deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "The first move we simply attempt to move a particle by changing its coordinates by a random unit vector, scaled by a _displacement parameter_. The second move is used to maintain a constant chemical potential of the salt particles so that we sample the _Grand Canonical Ensemble_ ($\\mu V T$).\n",
    "Here, each particle is associated with a chemical potential, $\\mu$, which contribute to the trial energy when deleting or inserting particles. The acceptance rules become,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "acc(N \\rightarrow N+1) = \\min \\left(1, \\frac{V}{N+1}e^{-(\\Delta U - \\mu)/k_BT}\\right )\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The insertion/deletion move leads to a fluctuating number of particles in the simulation box, and we can therefore calculate an _average concentraion_. The ratio between this and the input activity gives us the _activity coefficient_ which is the topic of the next section.\n",

    "\n",
    "** Question: insert particle pair-potential here **\n",
    "\n",
    "When salt is added to water, it dissociates into cations and anions, and due to the long-range nature of electrostatics ($1/r$), these influence each other over long distances.\n",
    "The particles thus cannot be regarded as _ideal_ - especially as the concentration is increased.\n",
    "Non-ideality in chemical systems is captured by the _activity coefficient_, $\\gamma_i$, which is a measure of the chemical potential ($\\mu_i$) change due to interactions,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_i = \\overbrace{ \\mu_i^{\\circ} + k_BT\\ln (N_i/V) }^{\\mbox{ideal}} + \\mu_i^{ex}\n",

    "where $a_i$ is the _activity_.\n",
    "Recall that the chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, is the free energy associated with adding a single species, $i$ to the system, while keeping all others constant. In practice this is not possible for salts, as they always come as electroneutral pairs. Instead we can define a _mean activity coefficient_,\n",

    "1. Give an expression for $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ for sodium sulphate?\n",

    "This important result is often used in MD/MC simulations to estimate free energy changes, for example the excess pressure by performing a _virtual volume move_ or the excess chemical potential by performing a _ghost particle insertion_.\n",
    "The latter is known as Widom particle insertion - see link above - and we will use this to calculate activity coefficients.\n",
    "As we already covered, the excess chemical potential, $\\mu_i^{ex}$, is the free energy _due to interactions_ upon inserting species $i$.\n",
    "During simulation we sample an unperturbed system (0) of $N$ particles and occacionally insert a ghost or virtual particle. Calculating the energy change of this process, $U^1=U-U^0$ we can thus estimate $\\mu^{ex}$. After the energy calculation, the particle is removed and it will not influence configurations of the reference system (0) which must remain _unperturbed_.\n",

    "In the above, activity coefficients or excess chemical potentials of ions were calculated simply from the average ion density in the grand canonical ensemble where activities are known and constant. An alternative method is to use Widom particle insertion which we covered in the theory section above.\n",
    "In the MC code this can be done by activating an insertion analysis in the input file. The appropriate input is already there (`analysis->widom`) but the interval to which to run it, `nstep` is set to zero. Setting this to a positive integers will activate the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the number of MC steps, set by `macro=10` and `micro=1000`, then an `nstep=50` will lead to 200 calls to the Widom analysis. For each call you may specify how many times to insert a particle, `ninsert`, which will multiply the number of samples and thus improve statistics. For each insertion, a ghost particle is inserted at a random position and its energy is calculated, whereafter it is removed.\n",
